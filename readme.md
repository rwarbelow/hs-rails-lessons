## Rachel's Notes

1) There are parts of the curriculum where something new is introduced (for example: HTML mixed with ERB, CSS, etc.) but not explained. Use your best judgement based on what you know about the group, their level of previous experience, and their ability to digest new information without being overwhelmed or shutting down to determine whether to dig deep into the context and explanation or just have the students copy-paste and give a high-level overview of what that part does.

2) Having teenagers work for several hours straight in unfamiliar concepts can be challenging. Therefore, I'd suggest breaking it up and inserting breaks, challenges, etc. frequently. For example: after a section of a lesson, have the group take a 2-min break, then give them some sort of question related to coding that they can find on the internet. Examples of challenge questions might be:

* When was the Ruby programming language invented?
* What are some prominent companies that use Ruby? 
* What is the average salary of a back-end developer? 
* What are some programming languages that are similar to Ruby?
* How old is Rails? 
* Find three interesting facts about the creator of Rails.
* ...ect.
