# Day 5: Bio Page & Presentation Practice

### Review

Review from yesterday:

* What were some of the challenges we faced when making our newsfeed page? How did we solve those? 

Preview Today:

Today, we will do two things:

* Create an "About Me" page with HTML & CSS
* Practice for our demos

### Creating the About Page

From the terminal, have students type:

```
rails generate controller Home about
```

If you want to go into the files that this command created, feel free. Again, use your judgement of what the group can handle.

Have students start up the server and navigate to `/home/about`. Tell students this is the page they'll be modifying for their bio information. Pose question: What is wrong with the links in our navbar now? Hopefully students notice that there is no navigation to get to the About page. Let's fix that. 

Inside of `application.html.erb`, have students add one more list item:

```
<li class="nav-item">
  <%= link_to "About", home_about_path %>
</li>
```

Save and refresh. 

Next, let's work on the About page. Have students go to `about.html.erb` nested under the `home` folder (which is one of the files generated by the rails generate command). 

We'll start by creating a photo carousel. Have the code below in a gist or other easily accessible place for students to copy:

```html
<div id="carouselExampleControls" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
  <div class="carousel-inner" role="listbox">
    <div class="carousel-item active">
        <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="http://hqpictures.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kitten-Pictures-900x400.jpg" alt="First slide">
        <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
            <h3>Caption</h3>
            <p>Description</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bullshireonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Puppy.jpg?resize=900%2C400" alt="Second slide">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
            <h3>Caption</h3>
            <p>Description</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="http://hqpictures.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Puffin-Wallpapers-HD-900x400.jpg" alt="Third slide">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
            <h3>Caption</h3>
            <p>Description</p>
        </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <a class="carousel-control-prev" href="#carouselExampleControls" role="button" data-slide="prev">
    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
  </a>
  <a class="carousel-control-next" href="#carouselExampleControls" role="button" data-slide="next">
    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
  </a>
</div>
```

You can explain that the classes and IDs give Bootstrap a way of knowing how to style certain pieces. 

From here, save and refresh. Have the students start the server if it's not running already and look at the page to see what they're creating. 

Tell students to pick out a few photos they have of themselves (either from an online source or from their phone/computer). 

If they need to resize images, they can use the [Online Photo Resizer Tool](http://www.photoresizer.com/) to crop, enlarge, or shrink an image. To save it, click in the workspace and press `command-s` on a Mac or `control-s` on a PC. 

Once they have their photos, have them change the `src` attribute for the three images. *Just FYI: The Bootstrap Carousel is weird with image size... it will probably look a little strange.*

*Note*: If they are uploading their own images, they can do that in Cloud 9 by first clicking on the images folder in the file tree (`/app/assets/images`) and then `File` menu -> `Upload Local Images`. Select the images and they will automatically be in the folder. 

Then, instead of the `<img...` tag, replace with erb:

```html
<%= image_tag("penguin.jpg", class: "d-block img-fluid") %>
```

Next, have them replace the `h3` and `p` tag caption and description placeholders with their own. 

Finally, have students go back to `about.html.erb` and delete these placeholder `h1` and `p` tags:

```html
<h1>Home#about</h1>
<p>Find me in app/views/home/about.html.erb</p>
```

Replace with this and have students fill in their own name. 

```html
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
  <div class="container">
    <h1 class="display-3">My Name</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

Then save and refresh. 

Finally, have students add a `p` tag between the jumbotron and the carousel. In here, have them write 5 sentences about themselves. 

Save and refresh. Tada!

### Optional Things

* Use Bootstrap classes to change the style of the nav links on the `application.html.erb` layout. For example, adding the classes `btn` and `btn-info` will give the nav links a light blue button display:

```html
<li class="nav-item btn btn-info">
  <%= link_to "About", home_about_path %>
</li>
```

Other options include `btn-secondary` (white with black border), `btn-primary` (dark blue), `btn-success` (green), `btn-warning` (orange), and `btn-danger` (red). Have students experiment with different button colors for their links. 

* We didn't do any styling to the `index.html.erb` page for users. If students want, they can style it similarly to how we did the index for statuses and images. 

### Presentation Practice

Brainstorm with students:

* If you were going to an app demo, what things would you want the programmer to talk about? 
* Discuss what features of the app to show
* Discuss what features of the code to show
* Discuss challenges in coding this app
* Discuss part they are most proud of in app

Give students time to make a bullet-point list outline of things they want to put into their presentation. 

I would have students practice with one partner first before demoing for the whole group using their notes.
